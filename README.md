# LA Fitness Front-End Rework

A short look at the LA fitness app along with their 2 star review on the Apple app store inspired me to remake the design. Built with React Native, Tailwind (Nativewind), & TypeScript. 

ðŸš¨ Update: I think they took my suggestions I sent in my email. Their app looks a lot better and uses some of my formating suggestions. 

## Screens

The new design consists of 4 sections that encapsulate the main functionality of their app. When the app is opened, the QR for the membership can be scanned immediately: something the current app suffers immensely with is loading the QR. Guests is the only other feature I have used, so that is immediately visible as well. The locations page is something I would like to see in production too.
